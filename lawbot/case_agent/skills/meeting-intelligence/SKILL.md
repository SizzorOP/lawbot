## Instructions

1. When provided with an audio recording or meeting transcript, use the
   configured transcription service (via a tool such as `transcribe_audio`) to
   convert speech to text.  Ensure the transcript is accurate and
   speaker‑labelled if possible.
2. Parse the transcript and identify key points: decisions taken, action
   items with responsible persons, deadlines and any legal advice given.
3. Summarise the meeting in a structured format and save it in the daily
   memory file.  Include a timestamp and meeting subject for easy recall.
4. Where follow‑up tasks are identified, use the calendar tools to
   schedule reminders or deadlines.
5. Maintain confidentiality; do not store sensitive client information in
   plain text if the memory system is not encrypted.  If sensitive
   information must be recorded, obfuscate or encode it.
