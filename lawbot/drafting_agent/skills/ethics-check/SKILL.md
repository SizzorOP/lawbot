  rules.

## Instructions

1. Before sending any final draft to the attorney or client, scan the
   document for potential ethical issues such as:
   - Disclosure of privileged or confidential information.
   - Advice that could be construed as illegal or unethical.
   - Clauses or arguments outside the authorised jurisdiction or
     practice areas.
2. Verify that citations have been checked with the `citation_checker` tool
   and accurately reflect the referenced cases or statutes.
3. If ethical issues are detected, revise the draft to remove them or
   request human review from the attorney.
4. Document any ethical interventions in memory with the date and
   description of the issue to improve future behaviour.
