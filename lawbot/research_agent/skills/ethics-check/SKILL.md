  rules.

## Instructions

1. Before sending any final research summary to the attorney, scan the
   content for potential ethical issues.  Specifically, check for:
   - Disclosures of privileged or confidential information.
   - Advice or instructions that could be construed as illegal or
     unethical.
   - Recommendations outside the agent’s authorised jurisdictions or
     practice areas.
2. Verify that all citations in the summary have been checked by the
   `citation_checker` tool and that they accurately reflect the
   referenced cases or statutes.
3. If an ethical issue is detected, either revise the content to remove
   the problematic material or request human review from the attorney.
4. Record any ethical interventions in memory to improve future
   behaviour.
