  Perform an ethics review on the agent’s outputs to ensure compliance
  with professional conduct, confidentiality and jurisdictional rules.

## Instructions

1. Before sending any final output to the attorney or client, scan the
   content for potential ethical issues.  Specifically, check for:
   - Disclosures of privileged or confidential information.
   - Advice or instructions that could be construed as illegal or
     unethical (e.g. evidence tampering, false statements).
   - Recommendations outside the agent’s authorised jurisdictions or
     practice areas.
2. Verify that all citations in the output have been checked by the
   `citation_checker` tool and that they accurately reflect the
   referenced cases or statutes.
3. If an ethical issue is detected, take one of the following actions:
   - **Revise the content** to remove the problematic material while
     preserving the core message.
   - **Request human review** from the attorney, highlighting the
     specific concern and recommending next steps.
4. Document any ethical interventions in memory, noting the date,
   description of the issue and resolution, to improve future behaviour.
